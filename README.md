# My second ever program!!! This took around 1-2 hours to create. Will soon learn about classes and implement them soon. To-Do-List is next!
# This is a password generator that includes the following features:
    • Generates 12-character length (cannot be exceeded) 
    • All text is updated through an entry box where a user can modify the password to suit their needs.
    
    • 94 characters including lower/uppercase letters, 0-9 numbers, and special characters.
    • A total of 4.76*10^23 outcomes and a probability of 2.10*10^-24 guessing the password.
    
    • A "show button" privacy button that hides all the characters with asterisks.
# Soon to come features:
    • "Copy to Clipboard" button
    • Password manager extension?
    • Not sure what to add so suggest any features that should be added!
